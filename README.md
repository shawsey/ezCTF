## SteelHacks 2020 Team Project - EZ_CTF

An online resource for beginners to understand, research, and complete caputure the flag challenges. 

## Inspiration

We have done may CTFs and realized when we started that many of the events are not very friendly to the beginner. So we decided to come up with a resource that will help beginners.

## What it does

EZ_CTF is designed to work like a jeopardy style CTF event but it is designed to challenge beginners but also allow them to find flags. This allows beginners to learn how a CTF works, build on their skills and not get discouraged by not being able to find flags. EZ_CTF allows users to learn how to do CTFs without the stress of a competition. EZ_CTF is not based on points

## How we built it

The backend of our program was made by utilizing the Laravel PHP framework, coupled with mysql and locally hosted with apache on XAMPP. The front end was made with some PHP, and HTML/CSS.

## Challenges we ran into

Networking can sometimes be a problem when trying to build a website. We spent sometime trying to figure out why it wasn't working. We also ran into some problems figuring out how we would get the challenges into the website and which ones would be appropriate

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

WE ARE proud that we were able to create a working website that has the information that is needed to run EZ_CTF this also includes the challenges and the files associated with the challenges.

## What we learned

We learned that creating a CTF event or a CTF practice website can be just as challenging as participating in an actual CTF. We also learned that we are capable of making a CTF like website with challenges and that can be somewhat challenging to users. (no pun intended)

## What's next for EZ_CTF

We are planning on adding to EZ_CTF and eventually using it to help new people with CTFs on our campus. We currently have a CTF club with members that are interested in CTFs but they feel discouraged because they are not able to find flags.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
